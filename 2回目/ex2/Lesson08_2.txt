In human robot conversation in a real environment, low speech recognition and unnatural response generation are critical issues. Most of autonomous conversational robotic systems avoid these issues by restricting user input and robot responses. However, such restrictions often make the interaction be boring because they are easy to predict a plot for a conversation.
This paper proposes using multiple robots as a solution of this problem. To explore the effect of multiple robots on a conversation, we developed an autonomous conversational robotic system and conducted a field trial in a real event. Our system adopted a button interface which restrict user input within positive or negative intention and proceeded a conversation by choosing proper one of prepared static scenarios. Through the field trial, we found that visitors who conversed with multiple robots continued their conversation longer and more improved their impression of the conversation than those who conversed with single robot.
The findings will contribute to the practical application such as advertising companion robots or educational robots in school.
